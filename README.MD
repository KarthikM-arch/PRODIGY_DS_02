# Task-02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project involves **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to uncover key insights, patterns, and trends. The notebook `Task-02.ipynb` provides a step-by-step approach to handle missing values, format data for analysis, and use various visualizations to explore variable relationships. In this analysis, the Titanic dataset from Kaggle is used as a sample, focusing on exploring relationships between variables such as `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, etc.

## Files in This Project

- **Task-02.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data preparation, cleaning, and exploratory analysis.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation and instructions on the project.
- **Dataset**: Download the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and save it in the project directory.

## Requirements
